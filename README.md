<h3>One reference to bring them in, One line to parse them,<br>
One framework to find them all and in object bind them.</h3>

ediFabric is a better way to:

- Parse and validate EDI documents to .NET objects or XML and vice verse. All you need to start with is a project reference and a line of code.

- Manage or extend EDI formats. We offer classes and XSD for most of the X12, EDIFACT and HIPAA versions or you can handcraft your own.

- Deliver value by alleviating the obscurity of EDI. This way you can carry on with your other tasks and do what you do best.
